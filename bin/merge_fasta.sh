Help message for merge_fasta.sh

DESCRIPTION:
	Returns a merged fasta file from multiple 

NOTES:
	- All echo prints are from STDERR (will not be redirected with '>', can be with '2>')
	- alignments are filtered for:
		1) single best alignment per read
		2) reads with a [block length]:[read length] ratio > 0.80


OPTIONS:
	-h	help	show this message
	-i	FILE	input fasta filename (should include full path)
  -s	STRING	Text for samplename to add to each header
	-o	FILE	output fasta filename (should include full path)

USAGE:
bash merge_fasta.sh -i <fasta file(s)> -o <path_to_final_fasta_file>
i="example1.fasta example2.fasta"
o="merged_fasta.fasta"
bash merge_fasta.sh -i "$i" -o "$o"
