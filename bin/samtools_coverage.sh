Usage: $0 [options]

This script runs samtools coverage on a BAM file and replaces reference names
in the output according to a provided mapping file.

OPTIONS:
    -h          Show this help message
    -b FILE     Input BAM file
    -m FILE     Reference name mapping file (original and new names, tab-separated)
    -o FILE     Output file for the modified samtools coverage results
    -c ARGS     Which column to use for mapping. Default is 2
    -o FILE     Output file for the modified samtools coverage results

The mapping file should have two columns:
1. Original reference name (as in the BAM file)
2. New reference name

Each line in the mapping file corresponds to one reference name mapping.

Example:
bash $0 -b input.bam -m mapping.txt -o coverage_output.txt
